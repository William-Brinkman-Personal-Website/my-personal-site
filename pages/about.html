            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm Will Brinkman and I'm a web developer from St. Louis. I've always had a strong interest in building things that can have a positive impact on people's lives, and that's what drew me to web development.
                 I love the idea that my work can potentially reach millions of people and make their lives easier or more enjoyable.
            </p>

                <h2>Skills and Expertise</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                    <li>React</li>
                    <li>HTML/CSS</li>
                    <li>Node.js</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    One of my favorite programming languages is JavaScript, and I enjoy working with the React framework.
                     I find the process of creating interactive web applications to be both challenging and rewarding. I'm always seeking out new technologies and tools to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in web development.

                <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
                <p>When I'm not coding, I have a few hobbies that keep me busy. I'm an avid cook and love trying out new recipes and experimenting with different ingredients. There's something very satisfying about taking raw ingredients and turning them into something delicious and nourishing.
                     I'm also into woodworking and enjoy building furniture and other items for my home.</p>

                <p>In my career as a web developer, my ultimate goal is to use my skills to make a positive impact on the world.
                     I believe that the web has the potential to be a force for good, and I'm excited to be a part of that. Whether it's creating tools that help people work more efficiently, building applications that connect people, or finding ways to use technology to tackle some of the world's biggest challenges, I'm eager to make a difference.</p>
